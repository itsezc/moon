Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. Thousands of teams use it for UI development, testing, and documentation. Itâ€™s open source and free.

Storybook v7 is typically coupled with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To scaffold a new Storybook project with Vite, run the following command in a project root. This guide assumes you are using React, however it is possible to use almost any (meta) framework with Storybook.

```shell
npx storybook init
```

> We highly suggest reading our documentation on [using Vite (and Vitest) with moon](./vite) 
> and [using Jest with moon](./jest) for a more holistic view.

## Setup

This section assumes Storybook is being used with Vite.

After setting up your Storybook, ensure your `<project>/moon.yml` has the following scripts:
```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
tasks:
    storybook:
        local: true
        command: "storybook dev"
        inputs:
            - "@globs(sources)"
            - "@globs(tests)"
            - ".storybook/**/*"
```

To run your Storybook dev server:
```shell
moon run <project>:storybook
```

### Vite integration

Storybook 7 uses Vite out of the box, as such no configuration is required but should you choose to extend the Vite config, you can do so by passing in `viteFinal`: 

```ts title=".storybook/main.ts"
// .storybook/main.js|cjs|ts

import { mergeConfig } from 'vite';

export default {
  stories: ['../stories/**/*.stories.mdx', '../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-links', '@storybook/addon-essentials'],
  core: {
    builder: '@storybook/builder-vite',
  },
  async viteFinal(config) {
    // Merge custom configuration into the default config
    return mergeConfig(config, {
      // Use the same "resolve" configuration as your app
      resolve: (await import('../vite.config.js')).default.resolve,
      // Add dependencies to pre-optimization
      optimizeDeps: {
        include: ['storybook-dark-mode'],
      },
    });
  },
};
```

For more information on how to integrate Vite with Storybook see the [relevant docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/react/builders/vite#configuration).

### Webpack integration

If you opt to use Webpack with your Storybook project, you can do so by passing it in the config:

Be sure to install the relevant packages:
```shell
npm install --save-dev @storybook/builder-webpack5
```

```ts title=".storybook/main.ts"
// .storybook/main.js|cjs|ts

export default {
  core: {
    builder: '@storybook/builder-webpack5',
  },
};
```

For more information on how to integrate Webpack with Storybook see the [relevant docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/react/builders/webpack).

### Jest integration

You can use Jest to test your stories, but isn't a requirement. Storybook ships with first party plugins for improved DX

Install the test runner and any relevant packages
```shell
npm install --save-dev @storybook/addon-interactions @storybook/addon-coverage @storybook/jest@next @storybook/testing-library@next @storybook/test-runner@next
```

Add the test task to your Moon project
```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
tasks:
    test:
        command: "test-storybook"
        inputs:
            - "@globs(sources)"
            - "@globs(tests)"
            - ".storybook/**/*"
```

Then you need to enable plugins and interactions in your Storybook project:
```ts title=".storybook/main.ts"
// .storybook/main.js|ts

export default {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: [
    // Other Storybook addons
    '@storybook/addon-interactions', // Addon is registered here
    '@storybook/addon-coverage',
  ],
  features: {
    interactionsDebugger: true, // Enable playback controls
  },
};
```

To test your Storybook project
```shell
moon run <project>:test
```

And start writing your tests, for an extended guide on how to write tests within your Stories see [writing an interaction test](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/interaction-testing#write-an-interaction-test) on the Storybook docs.
